# üõ∞Ô∏è OSINT by Gravity

Hi, I'm Gravity ‚Äî welcome to my OSINT journey!

I'm currently learning and exploring the world of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). This repository serves as a collection of write-ups and explanatory documents where I break down the solutions to various OSINT challenges I encounter along the way.

I'll be posting content gradually, focusing on clarity, methodical reasoning, and the use of publicly available tools and techniques.

Feel free to explore, learn with me, or share feedback!

üìÅ Each folder contains:
- A description of the challenge
- Step-by-step solution
- Tools and methods used
- Lessons learned

Stay curious.
